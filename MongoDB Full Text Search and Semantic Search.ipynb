So good!<br />* Ginger - Crisp natural ginger flavor, every bit as good as the fresh ginger candy we get locally<br />* Cranberry - Really very good and natural tasting<br />* Root Beer - Amazing, can almost feel the fizz!<br />* Green Apple - So good! Very natural apple flavor!<br />* Peach - Very good juicy peach flavor<br />* Strawberry - Very good, reminds me of strawberry and cream<br />* Lemon - A little milder than expected, very good \"clean\" flavor<br />* Black Cherry - Very natural tasting but a tad bit over sweet<br />* Grape - Great grape flavor, not quite as strong as expected<br />* Orange Punch - Good flavor, not overpowering<br />* Blueberry - Good, but somewhat understated<br />* Himalayan Sea Salt - Very odd choice for a jelly bean, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable flavor<br />* Bacon - Does indeed taste like sweet smokey bacon, a fun novelty flavor but not one I\\'m going to eat all the time<br /><br />My list of favorites differs a little in order from other members of my family, as might be expected since everyone has different tastes, but every one of these rates higher than any other manufacturers similar jelly bean flavor we have tried. Combining some of these flavors is also fun with ginger and lemon being my favorite, producing a very clean and refreshing sensation.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with 100% natural flavors and colors, and includes an impressive list of fruit concentrates fairly high up in ingredients list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH', 'Date': '2012-03-23'} \n",

I will stock up when it is at that price for sure!<br /><br />TIP:- I actually WET THIS FOOD DOWN quite a bit, to a thick spaghetti sauce consistency. It\\'s actually better for the cats b/c it increases their water intake which they desperately need since their thirst drive is so low. That helps prevent & control Urinary Issues such as: crystals, etc. ALL of my cats actually PREFER it this wetter way & it makes the can go a longer ways too, so more value!<br /><br /> I do cat rescue/fostering on occasion & this food has helped me nurse sick cats & kittens to health. The food is highly nutritious & easily digestable, therefore helping stomach & bowel ailments improve. I  also have a cat w/ chronic acid reflux disease & one prone to urinary crystals & this helps keep those conditions under control. Also my sister\\'s cat who was always snorty & snotty w/ allergies got completely better after being on this food, I believe due to no grain being used in this product.<br /> A good way to see how digestable a wet food is  to wet it down w/ water, it should easily dissolve in. A bad food will be chunky & hard to dissolve in water. Just think how it will act on a cat\\'s stomach! A lot of low quality cheap foods will just sit in the cat\\'s stomach, not absorbing any nutrients into the body & then it just comes out as smelly poop!  Also, because they are getting less nutrients, the cats will EAT MORE therefore costing more $ in food, more litterbox waste cuz it goes right through them. I actually have less litterbox waste when I use Wellness & the cats eat less cuz they are more full.<br /><br /> After the pet food contamination scare in 2007, I really educated my self on what actually is in pet food & boy was I freaked out. I used to buy Science Diet thinking it was good for my pets but the ingredients are not species appropriate or high quality AT ALL. Veterinarians are generally extremely undereducated in animal nutrition, and they generally tout the food from the company that sponsors their schooling or otherwise they have a vested financial interest in. After having my cats be on medicines & \"special vet diets\" that did little to help, I switched to high quality cat foods, Wellness being one of them and my cats are thriving and some of them have gone off their meds completely. I HIGHLY recommended the Wellness brand, I have seen a HUGE difference in my own cats as well as the cats I rescue.

I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.<br /><br />It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped. Personally, I would prefer if they were loose; even though we recycle all the little paper bags they come in, I would feel better if they didn't have those at all.<br /><br />Easy to give this product an enthusiastic five stars.  Highly recommended.\", 'Date': '2010-08-05'} \n",

It does not come with a battery or charger, and you really need 2 batteries so you can charge one while using the other.

Also, our puppy chewed through the wire connecting our computer to the Internet the first week we got him, making us nervous about a power cord in his space.<br /><br />We got a 2nd puppy.  A few days later we found the cover of his collar transmitter in the yard.  I guess the two dogs played too roughly and the transmitter came apart?  The button battery from the inside was missing, and it was 5:30 pm.  We looked in the grass for it til it got dark but never found it.  Swallowing a button battery is a medical emergency, kind of like appendicitis, only it can affect any part of the GI tract.  So we had to take both dogs to the emergency vet to get x-rayed to see if either had eaten the battery.  No battery in either dog, thank goodness, but we spent a bit more than $250 for that information.  The collar transmitter should have a screw or something to hold it together better.<br /><br />I am currently writing this from my bedroom, and I hear the door opening and closing over and over.

I find the taste very pleasant and am quite surprised to see so many negative comments on the taste. I suppose you must be used to eating natural foods to feel the way I do.

I mix the powder in about 6 oz. of organic white grape juice using a shaker and it tastes fantastic. It does have a grittiness to it as, again, it contains grass and algae and it does not dissolve, so be warned if you think you are buying a dissolvable product. I begin my day with Amazing Grass before eating anything. The ingredient list is impressive and contains a wealth of superfoods that are so important for optimal health and vitality.<br /><br />As for the effects on the body, you will notice BM regularity due in part to the wealth of probiotics, you may feel more energized, notice clearing of your skin, and a detoxing effect.

The first couple of times I tried it, it was okay. By the third time, I was really looking forward to it in a yummy way and missing it if I didn't have it. I started on it after a friend was treated for breast cancer, and her cancer doctor told her to get and stay on a green superfood. My husband had lung cancer and needed all the help he could get. I researched green superfoods on the Internet, and preferred the contents of this one because it had both fruits and veggies (most have only veggies) with great extras and minimal filler. I bought all the flavors to test, but he didn't like the smell (friends say it smells like wheat grass) and refused to try any of them. My daughter and I tested each and preferred the berry flavor in daily smoothies. The chocolate flavor tastes good, but has less fruit/veggie value. In blender: approx. 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 banana, squirt of honey, 5 +/- frozen strawberries and Amazing Grass green superfood. Add ice cubes if you like it thicker. It's great! On the cancer subject, I studied cancer survivors and what they attributed to their survival. Result: Consume lots of Flax Seed or Whey, lots of fruits/veggies, remove stress, and remove white sugar and processed foods from the diet. Cancer loves white sugar and fake sugars (Splenda, etc.). The American diet is killing us. Amazing Grass Green Superfood contains flax seed along with lots of natural antioxidant and immunity building fruits and veggies to ward off illness. I used to average two colds per winter. Since taking this (10 months), I can't remember the last time I was sick. My body feels good taking it, and yes, it does keep you regular in a good, natural way as it flushes the toxins out of your system. Just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, my husband refused to do any of the things learned from my studies and he succombed to cancer. I'm staying on the Amazing Grass Green Superfood because I don't want that to happen to me. And because it keeps my body feeling good.\", 'Date': '2011-02-10'} \n",

I will rate the ones out of 5 stars that I have tried, 1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cookie- 5 stars for this one, so delicious!!!  It tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up.  Such amazing texture and taste, it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up.  The flavor comes out so much better and texture too.  This has to be my favorite so far out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Pecan Pie- 5 stars for this one.  I am not a pie person at all, and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar I am hooked on its flavor.  It tastes just like pecan pie, no kidding.  It's so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing.  It has a very deep flavor, almost a caramel molasses flavor.  There are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself.<br /><br />Peanut butter and jelly- 4 stars for this one.  It tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  I grew up eating that stuff and it's so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar.  I only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious.<br /><br />Apple Pie- 2 stars for this one.  This was such a forgettable flavor, it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon.  Don't get me wrong, I know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones I have tried.<br /><br />Cherry Pie- 3.5 stars for this one.  This actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie. I bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not.  While this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that I would get excited over.  Very tart but I love the ratio of nuts they used.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough- 0 stars, and yes I can give zero stars if I want.  This bar I took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste.  Way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used.  I love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar.  If it were not for the chocolate chips I think that it would have been better.  Unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better.  If you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie- 5 stars for this bar.  This I was worried about trying because I am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but I want to try all of these bars, most of them anyways.  I was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was.  It was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor.  There is no added salt but I felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar.  This is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar.  I like this one on days when I do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill.  I have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but I can imagine they wouldn't be as good as this bar.<br /><br />I plan to try more so I will update this review soon.\", 'Date': '2012-06-07'} \n",

We go through LOTS of garlic at home, to the point where we'd be buying at least six large heads of garlic every week.  Super, I thought, three pounds of garlic delivered so I'll be stocked all the time!  The price for the size of the bag was very good, I thought.<br /><br />When I received the garlic, however, I was very disappointed in the quality.  I began using the garlic the very night I received it, so it was not sitting in my pantry for months.  Here is what I found:  Fully half the bag was either rotten, shriveled, or sprouting.  This is indicative of garlic that has been sitting around for some time and/or improperly stored.  When stored properly, fresh garlic remains fresh, firm, and crisp for weeks... or months.  Many of the heads in the bag were completely rotten all the way through.  Some were just light for their size and the cloves were wrinkled and shriveled.  An equal number were in an advanced stage of sprouting.  Those that were suitable for use were OK, but only just that.  These were not fresh heads of garlic.<br /><br />Very disappointed, I contacted Casa de Fruta via email.  After my second message, they were kind enough to ship a brand new bag immediately.  To their credit, the new bag of garlic arrived very quickly.  It was definitely better than the first, but I still lost about 10 heads of garlic to rot and shriveling; that's still a lot in a 3 pound bag, and what would have been a great deal for a full bag of fresh, crisp garlic turned out to be just a real disappointment and a bad deal for a bag of average-to-poor-to-unusable garlic.  For reference, I went through the entire second bag in less than a month, and it was stored in a cool, dry environment.  It was stored properly, in other words.<br /><br />So, at this point I don't know what to think.  I based my original purchase on the few - and all excellent - reviews and, indeed, I would have rated the garlic at 4 stars + had the second bag contained what I was expecting from the reviews.  That was not my experience, however.  It is possible, I suppose, that I was just twice unlucky.  Still, you'd think that the company would have made certain that the second bag sent, DUE to a customer complaint of quality no less, would have been totally primo.  I've got to go with the odds on this one then, and take my garlic business elsewhere.<br /><br />One final note:  Had it not been for courteous and timely response from the vendor, I would have rated this product at one star rather than two based on the quality.\", 'Date': '2010-08-04'} \n",

I got my first flower a few days ago, the first step towards tomatoes. Unfortunately, the pump on the device stopped working the next day.<br /><br />The FAQ on their web site advises me to open the device, take it apart, and clean the pump. They provide seven (7!) pages of instructions to follow and the process requires the use of a flat head screwdriver, small pliers, butter knife and soap. You also have to provide containers to put the liquid in and find a place for the plants that require their roots to be maintained under water. They claim the cleaning will take 20 to 25 minutes on the first attempt.<br /><br />It actually took about 15 minutes to complete, but then my pump was perfectly clean! The problem was not the pump, the problem was that the root system became so extensive after two months of growing, that the mass of roots blocked the pump intake located at the bottom of the tower.<br /><br />When your pump stops working, I suggest before you go to the bother of taking the pump apart, that you first try trimming the root system around the bottom of the pump tower. That is a MUCH EASER REPAIR compared to taking the whole thing apart. At any rate, I put everything back together, and the pump now works.<br /><br />I have several suggestions for AeroGarden management. Number one suggestion, do something about your NON RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Perhaps they answer the phone, but if you send them an email, don\\'t expect a response. Its been one week since I sent them a question about the pump failure... no response to this date. Email communications is worthless with this company, so if you need help, call them. From what I have read about their phone customer service, you might want to have a few snacks at hand and use a speaker phone so you can do other things while you wait.<br /><br />Number two, I suggest that management learn a bit about a concept called \"Maintainability\". Its related to designing a product so its easy to maintain. Apparently the pump on these things need to be maintained. A little point that is not mentioned in the sales literature. Having to take the thing apart to get at the pump so you can clean the filter is silly and reflects a lack of design competence. It would be a cinch to design something better this. I hope potential competitors are listening.<br /><br />Number Three, add to your pump failure instructions the fact that the root system could be blocking the water intake at the bottom of the pump tower. If your pump stops working, the first thing you should do is to move the roots away from the bottom of the pump tower. You can trim the bottom of the roots with a scissor if you are careful. If that works, you have just saved yourself a lot of trouble that you did not need to go through.<br /><br />Number Four, the growth feeding tablets are hydroscopic. That means they attract water. Keeping them in the little plastic bag provided will, in time, result in their merging together into a large amorphous mass. Management should provide a more water vapor resistant plastic vile to keep the growth feeding tablets in. Of course, that might cost five cents, so its not likely going to happen. So at the minimum, I suggest that users of the thing supply the necessary vile.<br /><br />In Summary, we have an intriguing product, where little attention has been devoted to maintenance design. We have incomplete instructions with respect to trouble shooting in the event the pump stops working. We have non responsive customer service, so if you do have a problem, and you expect to save your current plants, you are pretty much on your own.<br /><br />By the way, why is this thing called an \"Aero\" garden? Its a hydroponics garden so it would seem that \"Aqua\" or \"Hydro\" or \"H2O\" garden would be a more appropriate name.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? I bought the device because I wanted to learn more about hydroponics gardening. I expected little, so my expectations were met. Its a thought provoking gadget, but given all of the faults in conjunction with non responsive customer support, I have to rate it more in the un-met promise category... that\\'s two stars. I can\\'t justify higher ratings when you have a company that provides customer service at this level of ineptitude.<br /><br />Additional Info as of August 2008<br />I have tried an additional Cherry tomato crop (see my review of the cherry tomato seed kit).  Based on Amazon seed kit reviews, it appears that about 70% of the tomato seed kit reviews are negative. So its not just me. My second batch of tomato\\'s consists of a few marble sized yellow tomatoes, and NO red tomatoes. I am out of nutrients, and I am not going to pay AeroGrows inflated price for more nutrients. I suggest that the cherry tomato kits have a limited shelf life and that AeroGrow is ignoring that. What else can explain 70% negative reviews under controlled growing conditions? Save your money and don\\'t bother with the Cherry tomatos unless you are willing to throw the dice. I am going to try an herb kit next. If it does not do better, I will probably take the thing apart and redesign it correctly.', 'Date': '2007-11-30'} \n",

In his last few years, he had several people \"helping\" him with things around the farm - including fence building & repair. What I found, unfortunately, was an absolute mess.<br /><br />Before reviewing this charger, let me state that NO charger will work properly if your fence is in poor condition. My grandpa had a mix of wire, poly-tape, and poly-rope. His charger was connected to thin copper wire, and it was a \"continuous output\" charger, which should NOT be used with the polytape or rope. It will simply burn through them, which was happening a lot. A continuous output charger also does not allow some animals to \"release\" from the fence, so I was finding a lot of dead birds.<br /><br />In learning what I needed to fix the fence properly, I had a GREAT conversation with a technician at Fi-Shock. So big points to them on customer service. This guy knew what he was talking about, and gave me some fantastic advice on the wire I needed and the proper charger to use. I replaced the copper line that fed the fence with insulated, galvanized high-voltage line. I also replaced most of the poly-rope with tape. Initially I had an older intermittant charger, but found that the insulator was burned out and it was running in a \"continuous\" mode, too. That charger was putting out a full 4,000v and felt like a snake bite, but it actually caused a section of my fence to catch on fire!<br /><br />I purchased the Fi-Shock SS-550X charger through Amazon for a great price, compared to the MSRP. The other chargers we had were Fi-Shock and had held up well. Plus I appreciated their customer support and the information on their web site. Hooking up the charger was easy. I really like the green and red connector screws because they are easy to identify, and easy to use with gloves on. The charger also has a light which is easy to spot and which flashes to indicate the intermittant function.<br /><br />I have now had this charger in use for a couple of months, and it seems to be working pretty well. My only concern is that for @8 acres of fence, I\\'m only testing out at about 2 lights (2,000v) on my tester. Per the manual, that\\'s the expected number I should see. The charger is rated for \"1.2 KV +/- 20% open circuit voltage\" output to cover 15 acres, so it seems to be putting out the expected charge. It seems to be turning the horses for now, but I have NOT yet touched it yet (thankfully) to see how it feels. We just had an ice storm, and the SS-550X has hummed away while the fence was coated in ice - definitely a good thing! But for the keeping of four horses on 5 acres, I would like to have seen this charger be a little stronger (around 3k volts). When I would unhook my old charger, I\\'d get a little spark and the horses would jump. I liked that! They do not seem to register this one as much. I have my charger connected to two grounding rods to ensure I have a good ground.<br /><br />That said, my only real complaint - and the reason I have removed one star from my rating - is that recently the charger STOPPED working. Initially I could not figure out why. I checked the fuses, checked the fence, and checked the power source, but could not figure out the issue. Eventually I decided to just replace BOTH fuses (1/16 amp time-delay) with the extras from the package, which resulted in the charger working again. We had not had any storms in the area, so I can\\'t imagine what might have caused the fuse(s) to burn out. Oddly, NEITHER one looks to be blown, so I could not tell on visual inspection which one was bad. So it was a little disconcerting to see that my fence could go down all the way without some failsafe. I understand that the fuses are there to protect the charger in the event of a surge, but SOME indication they were blow - such as a failure light, a beep, or having the charger light turn red or something - would have helped tremendously. Fortunately I had the extra fuses, so I was back up and running quickly. But I have NOT been able to find the \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPAK00\">Time Delay Fuse, 1/16 Amp</a>\" at my local farm supply stores. If you are ordering the charger online, I would advise ordering extras.<br /><br />One final note: As a word of caution, this charger is intended for the keeping of livestock - not children. While a charged fence putting out @1500 volts may indeed keep unwanted animals and people off your property, it should NOT be implemented to keep children ON your property (as noted by the other reviewer). This charger has enough output to stop a human heart if the conditions are right.', 'Date': '2010-12-20'} \n",

They did fit the machine and are perfectly ejected after use.<br />It seems that some Amazon customers are giving bad reviews for this product because it is cheaper and it\\'s not Nespresso, which is not the point.<br />Firstly, these capsules are green and compostable. They cannot be a \"copy\" of Nespresso pods that are in aluminum, which is highly polluting. ECC capsules would be a \"copy\" if they were made in aluminum too!<br />Secondly, the ECC capsules are not that cheap, there is only a difference of 10 cents between Nespresso and ECC: I am not sure that people that bought a Nespresso machine and used to drink Nespresso pods are interested in a bargain of 10 cents because if they wanted to make real savings, they should have used ground coffee and stovetop espresso makers!!!<br /><br />As a result,<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU IF:<br />* you already have your favorite Nespresso \"grand crus\",<br />* you like the look of the aluminum capsules,<br />* you love George Clooney Nespresso commercials and keep saying \"What else?\" each time you drink a Nespresso coffee,<br />* you have the feeling to buy something luxurious each time you go to Nespresso club and you like it,<br />* you don\\'t care about the planet.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU IF:<br />* you don\\'t have a favorite Nespresso \"grand crus\", and you like espressos in general,<br />* you are not convinced by the recycling Nespresso thing because they did not try really hard to increase 5% of the total current recycled capsules(1),<br />* you think that ECC capsules is the answer to the Nespresso question \"What else?\",<br />* you like the idea of doing REALLY something to reduce the amount of polluting materials in your daily waste and think that recycling aluminum is not enough,<br />* you don\\'t care about the Nespresso club.<br /><br />(1) If Nespresso/Nestle did care that much about recycling, they would have entice their customers by giving them coupons for empty capsules brought back (as for the recycle of glass for example).<br /><br />Another thing, I saw a lot of reviews saying that these green pods do not work on Citiz or Nespresso branded machines. I am not even surprised. Nestle made everything he could to prevent the Ethical coffee Company to sell their products, but ECC found success in Europe since 2010. If this product was not working and was responsible for breaking machines, we should know it! As a consequence, I am not a conspiracy person but I would not be suprised that some of the bad reviews could come from Nestle itself. We are in an espresso-capsule-war, so this is business!<br /><br />P.S. 1 : I am not working for the Ethical Coffee Company and they don\\'t give me any money for rating their products. I am just a green costumer concerned about his carbon footprint.<br />P.S. 2 : The espresso taste is good! I used to drink espressos and ristrettos from semi automatic professional machines at work, but I did not want to do all the process by myself, so espresso capsule process is the perfect alternative for me! I am not a Nespresso aficionado so I am just talking about espresso here.<br />P.S. 3 : You have to firmly lower the level of your machine with these capsules. FIRMLY. The first time I tried, I was afraid time to break my Delonghi super expensive machine, but it\\'s ok. It\\'s seems to be due to the biodegradable capsule material that is less hard than aluminum (obvious).<br />P.S. 4 : It would be nice if the Ethical Coffee Company could put all theirs different products in a single degustation box, in this way you could choose your favorite flavors and only buy them. Because if you do not like the taste you are stuck with 49 capsules... it\\'s a bit rude!<br />P.S. 5 : It would be great (and logical) if the ECC capsules were really ethical: organic and/or fair trade certified.<br /><br />>>April, 25th 2012<br />After drinking ECC capsules for more than 2 months now, my conclusion is that -- at comparable intensities and blends -- the espresso tastes of both Nespresso and ECC capsules are good, and the differences between Nespresso and ECC are subtle. Since some capsules are compostable while other pollute like hell, I will stick with these green capsules because I hope soon to turn them (coffee+capsules) in compost for my palm trees.<br /><br />>>May, 2nd 2012<br />I\\'ve just started to compost the ECC capsules, I am very excited! The capsules should break down in 6 months according to the standard EN#13432.<br />I will let you know how quick they turn into compost! :)<br /><br />Go green!'} \n",

I was wondering about that; I\\'m glad I took time to reread that review prior to posting mine. [As will be evident, I read and benefited from each of the reviews here when I posted mine. Thank you!]<br /><br />I was sparked by SW\\'s reminder of different ways to use tuna besides immediately snarfing it out of the can [one of the reasons I was curious about BPA].  Sometimes I leave some in the can and dump the rest into a pretty glass bowl, then snarf it after setting the can down for Arzel, my godly cat. She has to wait for what I leave in the can for her when I use the first method [I don\\'t like to torture my cat with that type of wait].<br /><br />I love this tuna so much and have missed real tuna for so many years of increasing takeover of soybean ooze, I dropped back to inhaling this TUNA unadulterated, after I [thank God, Jeff Bezos, and Amazon Customer Reviews] discovered this divine presentation.<br /><br />In my first purchase I bought the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EYBB3A\">Wild Planet Wild Albacore Tuna No Salt</a>. It sold me on all counts of its advertised positives, including the fact that the can is packed with big chunks of tuna MEAT which hasn\\'t been smashed down into mush with lots of limp water and/or tons of soybean oil sludge.<br /><br />The Albacore was PRIME, but I missed the uniquely natural, intensely healthy saltiness which identifies tuna to me [anyone interested could read Dr. Batmanghelidj\\'s book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823\">Obesity Cancer & Depression</a>, if he wants to know about the healing qualities of the right type of salt]. So I tried this Skipjack version to see if it had more of the SALTY tuna taste I crave.  A habit suddenly dissipated, a habit I had worked into with the Albacore, after a few cans of Skipjack had been digested unadulterated, with YUM in every bite.<br /><br />In my long ago history of a sort of youth, when I could still see what tuna MEAT looked like in the can by evidence of it from a few un-smashed chunks big enough for human vision to register... way back then, I relished mixing mayo, chopped onions, garlic, celery, and sweet Gerkin\\'s, etc., into canned tuna, for a sandwich or salad.  Yeah, as a 1947 born Baby Boomer I also made curried tuna casseroles and fresh dill laced pot pies; I prepared tuna in black-olive-and-mushroom studded, black-peppered gravy [or topped with chopped onions and melted Swiss cheese], and generously slipped it over a fully toasted bun or bagel, etc.<br /><br />With this new dozen can collection of this Skipjack tuna, I found myself wanting to renew and expand that almost sacred recipe-rhapsody, minus soy, plus old-days healthy mayo; minus freshly-conjured, GMO-miasma-dredged additives; minus waste products declared illegal to touch or breathe being dumped into food products; you know, minus all that crud intelligent insects crawl away from when they\\'ll live and flourish on genetically unmodified crude oils.  Other much older living Kindoms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, insects, etc., maybe have developed a type of sentience, even wisdom we might not ever achieve, though I do have hope [not the fake-hype type].<br /><br />Oops. I may have turned over the tuna box and set my feet onto it, lol. Maybe that\\'s a hint I should look for some organic, non GMO, no soy soap?<br /><br />ANYway.  I searched Amazon for an organic, no GMO, NO SOY mayo so I could begin to reconnect with my yums of youth, which I may have never actually had... I did have honest \"yums\"; it\\'s the youth I question.  I may be getting one of those now, an attitude of youth, even though I\\'m dying from anti-nutrients not only passed off as, but pushed as \"food\"?<br /><br />Let the blessings begin, though they probably began with this Slipjack tuna. Here\\'s the blessing I discovered and bought [which I hope I live long enough to review with high level rapture]:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XH8T8U\">Wilderness Family Mayonnaise, Certified Organic, 16 fl. oz. jar</a><br /><br />That mayo and its family of producers is clearly blessed.<br /><br />But this Skipjack tuna is so good, I finally quit adding even this mayo to it [not to worry, this type of mayo has a universe full of yum-and-yell \"yes!\" uses].<br /><br />I take time to scoop the solid tuna meat out of the can and into a cut-glass, fancy dish only to leave some of it in the can for Arzel, though sometimes I put hers in cut-glass, too... until I realized she likes the can method because she can lick the tuna juice clean off the inside... which brings us back to what inspired this comment turned review:<br /><br />Thank you, SW, for each detail in your review, especially for answering the BPA question I had in the back of my mind when I took time to reread.<br /><br />As has been becoming a new habit, I meant to make a brief, off the top comment under a review I particularly appreciated, and ended up with more than the review I intended to write next.  Maybe there\\'s some type of magic in a comment box which works for me even better than the review form, though I like the ease of that setup, too.<br /><br />I opened a can of Skipjack before heading out to a local cafe for breakfast this morning; forked lifted some of the thick, lusciously dense meat into my cut-glass bowl, and left a good portion in the can for Arzel. I snarfed up several bites  [from my bowl] before storing the remainder in the fridge. I considered eating a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAO\">Larabar Ginger Snap</a>, too, in defense against the varieties of soy I would be eating next, but didn\\'t want to upset my appetite for a DENNY\\'S senior omelet. Hey! DENNY\\'s is an icon from my youth. I wouldn\\'t abandon it in its struggle through the dark ages of soy. [During one of my Dark Ages in February 1985 in Portland, Oregon, a Denny\\'s ambiance, one-egg-breakfast helped lift my spirit out of a black hole. I began writing my first novel there, that morning, truly on the back of an envelop.]<br /><br />I believe in getting a healthy core of food into me whenever possible, to counteract the soybean overwhelm I always try to work my soul around when eating in cherished restaurants of various types and locations, where I set up my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LB4A32\">Samsung NF210-A03 10.1-Inch Netbook</a> and type, type, type.<br /><br />[Actually my beloved do-everything netbook, which I bought from Amazon, is a Samsung N220 Plus, but it\\'s not available here currently, so I linked a comparable one above.]<br /><br />Someday maybe GM enhanced Organisms will connect their significant intelligence with some of the innocent good people residing within the GMO soybean pushers paradigm... and communicate to them what REAL FOOD is and precisely why it\\'s real. Maybe that core of realism will spread... like a good virus?<br /><br />Maybe the trick would be to have the good guys [caught in the soybean web con] alternate bites from a regular can of smashed soy tuna, with bites from this offering of WILD SKIPJACK.  YES!!!!<br /><br />Taste buds do have sentience.<br /><br />I\\'m just saying...<br /><br />I\\'m too old to use that expression, LOL!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt'} \n",

There is no information on the website I could find that said this was an imported item. Thirdly, as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the product (package crackers) are broken as the other reviewers have mentioned. Last but not least-the taste. To me, who\\'ve been eating Ritz crackers ever since they came out, the taste is totally different than a partial box of Ritz crackers I had in my cupboard. The only way I can describe this is more of a wheat like taste very unlike the original American made Ritz cracker. I have to say though, that Amazon.com customer service was very good about this and refunded me the money I spent as I am a person who believes in buying as much American-made product as I can. I am not a complainer and most of the items I\\'ve received from Amazon\\'s gourmet foods have been packaged well and are as described on Amazon.com\\'s website accurately. If you are Chinese, please do not take offense to this as most of the electronic items in my home (name brand items like Samsung etc.) are made in China or another country outside of the United States. When it comes to food however, I prefer to stick to America-made products exclusively-does that make me a bad person?.<br /> I never thought at my age ( almost 70 years old and disabled) that I would be spending time writing reviews although I\\'m aware that most Americans would like to know where their food is made.

One package of the spaghetti, for instance, is very slight. Only half pound (for those used to full pound spaghetti boxes). So, I used both boxes so I\\'d have leftovers for a couple days for me and hubby. Somehow, I don\\'t understand why the equivalent size to a standard spaghetti box has to be like five to six times as much (since I can get a box of spaghetti of decent to good quality locally for a buck to a bit more). These, at this amazon price of 18 bucks for six samplers, means each box averages 3 bucks. Two boxes of spaghetti to make one pound--6 or more bucks for that quantity. Nuts. It\\'s PASTA! They\\'re adding fiber, not truffle oil!<br /><br />A thumbs up. It may not suit a true pasta gourmet, but it makes me very happy...except for the price. But, well, even Dreamfields (my previous higher fiber pasta, which I\\'ll still buy from time to time) isn\\'t cheap compared to the regular pastas<br /><br />Enjoy.'} \n",

I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.

There are supposedly 400 servings (1/40th of a teaspoon) in a .4 ounce container, so it works out to be a fairly inexpensive natural, non-sugar sweetener and dietary supplement - less than 2 cents per serving and 1.5 cents per serving with Subscribe and Save - though it will take you a long time to use up one container, let alone four.  This extract has the sweetness of 300 - 360 times that of sugar, is a Kosher product, and it contains no additives.  Also the .4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top, so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home.  You could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes.  I started out using this in tea and I am now using it in my coffee as well.  It mixes fairly well in hot drinks.  It's easy to get used to the flavor in tea, but may take you some time in coffee. I think that it's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste.  The end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day, you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure.  Every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates, 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories.  If you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks, you would be saving 75 calories per day - a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long-term weight loss.  The flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf (blehhh!) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface.  Also as compared with Truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products, it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure - not multi-layered.  If you want to enhance the flavor and it doesn't conflict with your diet regimen, consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage.  I am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe.  Chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively.  I am not sure how to use stevia for baking.  That will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners.<br />In all fairness, I have only tried Truvia once in tea, and I found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia.  Many sweeteners come in single serving packets, and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving. Why not start with a pure product?\"} \n",
